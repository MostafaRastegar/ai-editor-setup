# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
- **Cursor Pro is expensive**: $20/month is too much for many developers
- **Limited alternatives**: Most AI coding tools are either expensive or limited
- **Complex setups**: Existing solutions often require Docker, databases, or complex configuration
- **Privacy concerns**: Many AI tools require cloud access and data sharing

### Solution
A simple, cost-effective AI coding assistant that:
- Uses VS Code + Cline extension
- Integrates with OpenRouter for affordable LLM access
- Provides built-in context management
- Runs entirely locally (except for LLM calls)
- Offers same quality as Cursor at 85-95% lower cost

## How It Should Work

### User Experience
1. **Install VS Code** (if not already installed)
2. **Install Cline extension** from marketplace
3. **Get OpenRouter API key** (free/cheap)
4. **Configure Cline** with API key and model
5. **Start coding** with AI assistance

### Core Features
- **Code Generation**: Write functions, classes, and entire files
- **Code Editing**: Modify existing code intelligently
- **Bug Fixing**: Identify and fix issues
- **Refactoring**: Improve code structure and quality
- **Multi-file Operations**: Work across multiple files
- **Terminal Commands**: Execute commands directly
- **Context Understanding**: Understand entire project structure

### User Journey
1. **Discovery**: Find project through GitHub, documentation, or word-of-mouth
2. **Setup**: Follow simple installation guide
3. **Configuration**: Add API key and select model
4. **First Use**: Test with simple coding tasks
5. **Daily Use**: Integrate into regular development workflow
6. **Advanced**: Use Memory Bank and advanced features
